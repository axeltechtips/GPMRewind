# GPMRewind

GPMRewind is a custom-built application designed to look and function like the original **Google Play Music**. Our goal is to revive the beloved features of Google Play Music by integrating the **YouTube Music API**, providing cloud storage and music playback capabilities. 

Just so you know, this is not the original Google Play Music client, but a reimagined version built from the ground up.
